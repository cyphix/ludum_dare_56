Frecko - Ludum Dare 56 (Tiny Creatures)
======

Control Frecko and gobble up Globbers so you can feel full. But beware, the Apex is hungry too!

##### Mechanics
- Run into Globbers (little green blobs) to kill them. They will drop meat that you can eat. Be careful not to leave it for too long, it'll rot.
- Frecko has a stomach bar on the bottom right of the screen. He can only hold ten pieces of meat in his stomach at once. A digestion timer runs below it showing how long until a piece can be digested.
- If Frecko's stomach is empty, his digestive processes continues. He takes damage until he eats again.
- If Frecko is hurt by Thorns (brown tubular things) or the Apex, then he will be invulnerable for a short period of time.
- To win the game, **digest** 30 pieces of meat. Frecko's stomach starts with 5, so you only need to get 25!
